        Vegetarian recipes, excellent for those who have opted for a
        vegetable-based diet, a vegetarian diet is also ideal for purifying your
        body. Vegetarian cuisine excludes the use of meat of any species from
        human nutrition but does not exclude foods of animal origin, such as
        eggs, milk and its derivatives, which are suitable for all ages.
        However, there is a "pure" vegetarianism that excludes, always and in
        any case, also any products deriving from animals and therefore also
        milk and dairy products, basing the diet exclusively on substances of
        vegetable origin.
